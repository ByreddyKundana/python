# program to add two numbers

a=int(input("enter the first number: "))
b=int(input("enter the second number: "))
c=a+b
print("the sum of two numbers is: ",c)
print ("the average of twp numbers:",c/2)

#program to find remainder when two numbers are divided

number=int(input("enter the number: "))
print("remainder when the number is divided by 2 is: ",number%2)

#check the type of variable assigned using input () function
a=input("enter something: ")
print("The type of a is: ",type(a))

# using comparison operators to find out whether a given variable a is greater than b or not
# take a=34 and b=80

a=34
b=80

print("a is greater than b is:",a>b)

# to find the square of a number

a=int(input("enter the number to be squared: "))
print("the square of the  number:",a*a)
